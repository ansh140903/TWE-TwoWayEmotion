# TWE-TwoWayEmotion
 Human-computer interaction often lacks emotional intelligence, limiting personalized user experiences. Existing systems for emotion   recognition are either inaccurate or not suited for real-time applications. This project aims to develop an efficient, real-time facial emotion recognition system using deep learning, addressing challenges in mental health monitoring, customer service, and behavior analysis by leveraging the 'fer2013.csv' dataset.
